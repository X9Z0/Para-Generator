# Para Generator

I have created a simple React application called Para Generator for practicing purposes. It generates a paragraph based on the number input provided by the user.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
5. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
6. Input a number in the text field.
7. Click on the "Generate" button.
8. View the generated paragraph below the input field.

Feel free to explore the code and modify it according to your needs!

### Note

This project is a simple demonstration created solely for practicing React and Vite. It does not have any additional functionality beyond generating paragraphs based on user input.
